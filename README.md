This project focuses on analyzing social media usage patterns to understand their impact on user behavior, productivity, satisfaction, and addiction levels. Using a large, realistic dataset, the study applies data analysis, visualization, and machine learning techniques to extract meaningful insights and build predictive models.

The goal is to identify key behavioral factors that contribute to excessive social media use and help design data-driven solutions for healthier digital habits.

🤖 Machine Learning Model

A predictive model is being developed to estimate social media addiction levels using behavioral features such as:

Usage time

Scroll rate

Engagement metrics

Sleep patterns

Productivity impact

The model aims to help identify high-risk users based on activity patterns.

📌 Key Insights

Moderate scrolling behavior is the most common among users.

High usage time strongly correlates with productivity loss.

Sleep deprivation is linked with higher addiction levels.

Engagement metrics (likes/comments) influence satisfaction.

Certain platforms show higher addictive tendencies.

🎯 Future Improvements

Deploy the prediction model as a web app (Streamlit)

Integrate real-world datasets

Add deep learning models

Perform longitudinal behavior analysis

Build a recommendation system for healthy usage
